Rinchi-XMLSchema version 0.02
=============================

This module parses XML Schema files and produces Perl objects representing 
them. There is also the capability to compare objects to see if they are the 
same (not necessarily equal). The intent of this module is to allow the 
comparison of various schemas to find common constructs between them. A 
module I intend to release later will allow the production of UML from
schema files.
  
Note: Imports and includes are not performed as at this time that would be
contrary to the purpose of the module.
